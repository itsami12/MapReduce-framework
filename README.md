# MapReduce Framework Implementation

This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic **MapReduce framework** using C/C++. It showcases parallel processing concepts, including concurrency and synchronization, to handle distributed data processing tasks. The primary goal is to process text data to count word frequencies.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

The MapReduce framework consists of three main phases:

### 1. **Map Phase**
- Splits input data into smaller chunks.
- Processes each chunk in parallel.
- Produces intermediate key-value pairs.

### 2. **Shuffle Phase**
- Groups key-value pairs by their keys.
- Ensures all values corresponding to a key are processed together.

### 3. **Reduce Phase**
- Aggregates values for each unique key.
- Produces the final result by combining values.
